Question 1

List the symbols for each of the below Javascript operators;

1) Arithmetic Operators:
   Addition (+) 
   Subtraction (-) 
   Multiplication (*) 
   Division (/) 
   Modulo operator (%) 
   Exponentiation operator (**) 
   Increment operator (++) 
   Decrement operator (--)

2) Assignment Operators: 
   Equals sign (=)

3) Comparison Operators: 
   Greater than (>) 
   Greater than or equal to (>=) 
   Less than (<) 
   Less than or equal to (<=)

4) Logical Operators: 
   Logical AND (&&) 
   Logical OR (||) 
   Logical NOT (!)

5) Bitwise Operators: 
   Bitwise AND (&) 
   Bitwise inclusive OR (|) 
   Bitwise exclusive OR (^)
   Left shift  (<<) 
   Right shift (>>)
   Bitwise NOT (~)



Question 2

Give two(2) examples of each JavaScript operator

Examples of Arithemetic operators
1) let a = 8;
   let b = 5;
   console.log(a + b)

2) let a = 8;
   let b = 5;
   console.log(a * b)

Examples of Assignment operators 
1) A = 12

2) A += B;  
   Or   
   A = A + B;  

Examples of Comparison operators 
1) 6 > 12  //returns false

2) 6 <= 12  //returns true

Examples of Logical operators 
1) x = 4
   y = 2
   x < 10 && y > 1  //returns true

2) x = 4
   y = 2
   x == 8 || y == 8  //returns false

Examples of Bitwise operators 
1) 6 & 3  //returns 2 

2) 6 | 6  //returns 6



Question 4

for (let i = 1; i < 20; i =+ 7) {
    console.log(i)
} 

When the program above is executed, the result of the 'for' loop is; 1, 8, 15
